**What would you like to be added**: ability for data entry that allow users add their feedback, actions or other data.
Example: assume grafana pulling data from mssql table and there's one fieled nead to be filled by end user (related ticket#), 
So can grafana support such integration to add engineer feedback and return back to the original database table? 

**Why is this needed**:using single and unified visualization platform (grafana in our case) for all related activities.
